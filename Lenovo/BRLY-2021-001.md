## Potential impact

An attacker with local privileged access can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode, and install a firmware backdoor/implant. The malicious code installed at the SMM level could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by malicious actors to bypass UEFI firmware security mechanisms (include Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors) and in some cases would allow an attacker to modify the firmware storage on SPI flash chip to gain persistent infection on the target platform.

## Vulnerability description

Vulnerability exists in the software System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler located at the address 0x48C of the module LenovoSmapiSmm (code example given from r0juj20w firmware).

SWSMI handler at offset 0x48C (SwSmiHandler_48C) dereferences gRT (EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES) pointer to call a ResetSystem function, which can result in code execution in SMRAM and escalating privilege from ring 0 to ring -2.

Passing RAX = 0x5380, RBX = 0x7003 to SwSmiHandler_48C via CPU save state (ReadSaveState) will trigger the following vulnerable code:

```c++
__int64 __fastcall SwSmiHandler_48C():

  case 0x7003u:
    gRT_1B00->ResetSystem(EfiResetShutdown, 0i64, 0i64, 0i64);
    goto LABEL_132;
```
