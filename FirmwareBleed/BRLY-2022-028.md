# [BRLY-2022-028]
# Absence or incomplete applying the Return Stack Buffer (RSB) stuffing mitigation logic before resuming from SMM

## Summary

**BINARLY efiXplorer team** discovered that most enterprise vendors are affected by not correctly applying the Return Stack Buffer (RSB) stuffing mitigation logic before resuming from SMM (RSM instruction).

## Information

* BINARLY internal identifier: BRLY-2022-028
* Intel PSIRT assigned CVE identifier: [CVE-2022-38087](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00807.html)
* FwHunt rule: [BRLY-2022-028](https://github.com/binarly-io/FwHunt/blob/main/rules/MitigationFailures/RsbStuffingCheck.yml)
* CVSS v3.1 Score 5.5 Medium AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

## Affected products with confirmed impact by Binarly team

Incomplete list of affected devices can be found in our [FirmwareBleed repository](https://github.com/binarly-io/FirmwareBleed/blob/main/rsb_research_results.csv).

## Potential impact

The impact is focused on disclosing the content from privileged memory (including protected by virtualization technologies) to obtain sensitive data from processes running on the same processor (CPU). Cloud environments can have a greater impact when a physical server can be shared by multiple users or legal entities.

## Description

The main CPU cores may use branch predictors other than the Return Stack Buffer (RSB) when the RSB underflows. Basically, RSB predict the target of RET instructions but when RSB underflows happen some of the CPU cores could fall back to using other branch predictors.

The best mitigation practice introduced by Intel in 2018 to address RSB behavior in SMM runtime was to leverage CALL instructions before returning from SMM context to avoid interfering with non-SMM usage of the retpoline mitigations. Regardless of whether Windows and Linux operating systems retpoline or not, if the SMM (SMI handlers) in system firmware don't have mitigations in place, an attack window will be available by design.

The [original patch](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/commit/02f7fd158e977d0368705129c52a800217fe8887) with mitigation code has been pushed by Intel to EDKII github repository in August 2018 to `PiSmmCpuDxeSmm` module to mitigate `CVE-2017-5715` by adding Return Stack Buffer stuffing logic before resuming from SMM.

On AMD and Intel processors based on EDKII system firmwares, the same mitigation logic applies and the same mistakes in implementation too.

As an example, most of the analyzed UEFI firmwares images (most recent versions) have multiple cases when Resume from SMM (RSM) in `SmiEntry` is not mitigated. In the code of the `PiSmmCpuDxeSmm` there are three RSM instructions and two RSB stuffing mitigations. However, the third one does not. Additionally, the first two (where RSB stuffing is present) are not used during exit from SMM. The following figure shows the correct applied RSB stuffing mitigation (StuffRsb EDKII macros):

On the other hand, during our research we found places where RSB mitigations are missed before the RSM instruction is executed in `SmiEntry` routine.

Code snippet without `StuffRsb` mitigation before RSM in `SmiEntry` presented below:

This code pattern was obtained from Intel NUC M15.

On the another Intel-powered platforms, we also found alternate code patterns. Below is the similar code to `SmiEntry` from EDKII without RSB stuffing:

Applying the RSB stuffing mitigation incorrectly can lead to the following security issues:

* UEFI firmware does not have any RSB mitigations
* UEFI firmware has RSB migitations in some places, but the code flow exposed to the operating system is not mitigated

## Recomendations

The Binarly team recommends applying mitigation code before every RSM instruction that can be executed during runtime.
