# SMM callout vulnerability in SMM driver on multiple HP devices.

## Summary

**BINARLY efiXplorer team** has discovered a SMM callout vulnerability on multiple HP devices allowing a possible attacker to hijack execution flow of a code running in System Management Mode. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.

## Vulnerability Information

* BINARLY internal vulnerability identifier: BRLY-2021-041
* HP PSIRT assigned CVE identifier: [CVE-2022-23933](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_5817864-5817896-16)
* CERT/CC assigned case number: VU#683814
* CVSS v3.1 8.2 High AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in the SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by the UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

The vulnerability exists in the child SW SMI handler registered with GUID `3894c800-a50a-4cb2-afbc-9f0118377412` and located at offset `0x1988` in the driver.

The pseudocode for this handler is shown below:

```c++
EFI_STATUS __fastcall SmiHandler_1988(
        EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
        const void *Context,
        void *CommBuffer,
        UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  if ( CommBuffer )
  {
    if ( CommBufferSize )
    {
      if ( *(_DWORD *)CommBuffer == 'DFCH'
        && !gBS->AllocatePool(EfiBootServicesData, 175 * BlocksNum, (void **)CommBuffer + 2) )
      {
        DstBuffer = *((_QWORD *)CommBuffer + 2);
        Size = 175 * BlocksNum;
        *((_QWORD *)CommBuffer + 1) = BlocksNum;
        if ( DstBuffer )
        {
          if ( Size && gSrcBuffer && DstBuffer != gSrcBuffer )
            CopyMem(DstBuffer, (const __m128i *)gSrcBuffer, Size);
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

As we can see from this pseudocode, the `AllocatePool` service from the `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` table is used.

Usage of `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` and `EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES` is unsafe inside a code intended to run in the SMM (from SMRAM), especially in SMI handlers, because an attacker capable of executing code in DXE phase could exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to SMM (ring -2).

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. Find `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` table in system memory.
2. Overwrite `AllocatePool()` service pointer in it with the shellcode address.
4. Trigger the SW SMI Handler (SW SMI number and pointer to Communication Buffer are specified in UEFI ACPI table) via `0xB2` IO port.
