# SMM callout vulnerability in SMM driver on multiple HP devices.

## Summary

| [Device](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-prodesk-405-g6-small-form-factor-pc/38230306) / firmware version: `02.05.01 Rev.A` | 0511 | 0c490900ab673a1cb54828b4c80681fa140ca4fe35cbd7ea5be7a87c3d527652 | 0D966D65-8F25-4574-8EAF-6C0463F38742 |

## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in the SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by malicious actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by the UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

The vulnerability exists in the child SW SMI handler registered with GUID `807ca9f6-216c-4cbc-87f7-3cd555887208` and located at offset `0x17C8` in the driver.

The pseudocode for this handler is shown below:

```c++
EFI_STATUS __fastcall SmiHandler_17C8(
        EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
        const void *Context,
        CommBufferStruct *CommBuffer,
        UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  if ( CommBuffer )
  {
    if ( CommBufferSize )
    {
      Size = *CommBufferSize;
      if ( (-(*CommBufferSize != 160) & EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER) == 0 )
      {
        Res = 0;
        if ( Size )
          Res = SmmIsBufferOutsideSmmValid(CommBuffer, Size);
        if ( (-(Res == 0) & EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER) == 0 )
        {
          Status = -(CommBuffer->Sig != 'GFCU') & EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER;
          if ( CommBuffer->Sig == 'GFCU' )
          {
            if ( CommBuffer->Case == 16 )
            {
              if ( !gBufferPtr1 )
              {
                BufferPtr1 = GetCopy(120, &CommBuffer->BufferPtr1);
                BufferSize = CommBuffer->BufferSize;
                BufferPtr = CommBuffer->BufferPtr;
                gBufferPtr1 = BufferPtr1;
                sub_2288(BufferPtr, BufferSize);
                // Vulnerability here
                PcdProtocol = BsLocatePcdProtocol();
                if ( (PcdProtocol->Get8)(0x2C4) == 1 )
                  HandlerUnregister();
              }
            }
            ...
          }
          ...
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

In this case `CommBuffer` has following structure:

00000000 CommBufferStruct struc ; (sizeof=0xA0, mappedto_234)
00000000 Sig             dd ?
00000004 Case            dd ?
00000008 BufferPtr       dq ?
00000010 BufferSize      dq ?
00000018 BufferPtr1      dd ?
...
00000098 Status          dq ?

If `CommBuffer->Sig == 0x47464355 && CommBuffer->Case == 16 && !CommBuffer->BufferPtr1` following code will trigger:

```c++
BufferPtr1 = GetCopy(120, &CommBuffer->BufferPtr1);
BufferSize = CommBuffer->BufferSize;
BufferPtr = CommBuffer->BufferPtr;
gBufferPtr1 = BufferPtr1;
sub_2288(BufferPtr, BufferSize);
// Vulnerability here
PcdProtocol = BsLocatePcdProtocol();
if ( (PcdProtocol->Get8)(0x2C4) == 1 )
  HandlerUnregister();
```

Below is the pseudocode of the `BsLocatePcdProtocol` function:

```c++
PCD_PROTOCOL *BsLocatePcdProtocol()
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  result = gPcdProtocol;
  // gPcdProtocol equals zero on first call 
  if ( !gPcdProtocol )
  {
    // Executed only once
    gBS->LocateProtocol(&PCD_PROTOCOL_GUID, 0i64, &gPcdProtocol);
    return gPcdProtocol;
  }
  return result;
}
```

As we can see from this pseudocode, the `LocateProtocol` service from the `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` table is used to get the `PCD_PROTOCOL` interface. After this, a function from `PcdProtocol` will be called: `(PcdProtocol->Get8)(0x2C4)`.

Usage of `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` and `EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES` is unsafe inside a code intended to run in the SMM (from SMRAM), especially in SMI handlers, because an attacker capable of executing code in DXE phase could exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to SMM (ring -2).

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. Set up a Communication Buffer:

    * CommBuffer->Sig = 0x47464355 (`"GFCU"`)
    * CommBuffer->Case = 16
    * CommBuffer->BufferPtr1 = 0

2. Find `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` table in system memory.
3. Overwrite `LocateProtocol()` service pointer in it with the shellcode address.
4. Trigger the SW SMI Handler (SW SMI number and pointer to Communication Buffer are specified in UEFI ACPI table) via `0xB2` IO port.
