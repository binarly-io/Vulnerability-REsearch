## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability could potentially be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

In the function at offset `0x1294` (image sha256: `63d2e3d3d8308b77bc35c96098b7b2d9eb119d89e467a6cd5ac82d2e8eef84ec`), the child software System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler with GUID `4b52e4da-60eb-4ec2-a80c-f9fd0ab85e97` is registered:

```c++
__int64 sub_80001294()
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  v0 = 0;
  if ( SmstIsNotNull() )
  {
    result = gEfiBootServices->LocateProtocol(&EFI_SMM_ACCESS2_PROTOCOL_GUID, 0, &EfiSmmAccess2Protocol);
    if ( result < 0 )
      return result;
    Size = 0;
    EfiSmmAccess2Protocol->GetCapabilities(EfiSmmAccess2Protocol, &Size, 0);
    SmramMap = 0;
    gSmst_36F0->SmmAllocatePool(EfiRuntimeServicesData, Size, &SmramMap);
    EfiSmmAccess2Protocol->GetCapabilities(EfiSmmAccess2Protocol, &Size, SmramMap);
    gSmramRangeCount = Size >> 5;
    return gSmst_36F0->SmiHandlerRegister(SmiHandler_1278, &gSmiHandlerGuid, &DispatchHandle);
  }
  else
  {
    CommBuffer = sub_80001878(56);
    if ( !CommBuffer )
      return EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES;
    (CreateEventEx)(8);
  }
  return v0;
}
```

Find below the decompiled SWSMI handler code:

```c++
EFI_STATUS __fastcall SmiHandler_1278(
        EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
        const void *Context,
        void *CommBuffer,
        UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  if ( *CommBuffer == 1 )
    sub_80001454(CommBuffer);
  return 0;
}
```

If the first QWORD from `CommBuffer` is `1`, the function `sub_80001454()` will be called. Part of its decompiled output is shown below:

```c++
__int64 __fastcall sub_80001454(void *CommBuffer)
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  RangeCount = gSmramRangeCount;
  TotalSize = 0;
  if ( gSmramRangeCount )
  {
    p_PhysicalSize = &SmramMap->PhysicalSize;
    do
    {
      TotalSize += *p_PhysicalSize;
      p_PhysicalSize += 4;
      --RangeCount;
    }
    while ( RangeCount );
  }
  *((_QWORD *)CommBuffer + 2) = TotalSize;
  ...
  *((_QWORD *)CommBuffer + 1) = 0;
  *((_QWORD *)CommBuffer + 3) = Value;
  return result;
}
```

This shows that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th QWORDs from the `CommBuffer` will be overwritten.

There is no pointer validation carried out (to ensure `CommBuffer` and any other Communication Buffer nested contents are not pointing to SMRAM contents). Thus, a potential attacker can write fixed data to SMRAM to corrupt some data inside this memory (for example, change SMI handler's code or modify Smram Map structures to break input pointer validation for other SMI handlers, hence to completely make this mitigation inefficient). This could lead to gaining arbitrary code execution in SMM.

To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to wrap all the input pointers (including the nested pointers) for SMI handlers with sanity checks to make sure they are not pointing into SMRAM.
