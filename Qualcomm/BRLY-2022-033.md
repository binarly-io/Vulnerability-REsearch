## Potential impact

An attacker with local privileged access can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 3 or ring 0 (depends on the operating system) to a DXE Runtime UEFI application and execute arbitrary code.
A malicious code installed as a result of the vulnerability exploitation in a DXE driver could survive across an operating system (OS) boot process and runtime or modify NVRAM area on SPI flash storage (to gain persistence on target platform).
Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by threat actors to bypass OS security mechanisms (modify privileged memory or runtime variables), influence on the OS boot process, and in some cases would allow an attacker to hook or modify EFI Runtime services.

## Vulnerability description

The pseudocode of the vulnerable function is shown below:

```c
__int64 sub_66E8()
{
  // ...

  __int64 DataSize;
  unsigned __int8 Value;
  int v31;
  __int64 v32;
  unsigned int v33;
  __int64 result;

  result = 0;
  v33 = 1;
  v32 = 32;
  v31 = 32;
  DataSize = 1;
  result = gRT->GetVariable(L"UsbConfigPrimaryPort", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, &Value);
  if ( result >= 0 )
    LODWORD(v32) = sub_6528(Value);
  else
    LODWORD(v32) = 32;
  result = gRT->GetVariable(L"UsbConfigSecondaryPort", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, &Value);

  // ...
}
```

As we can see from the pseudocode, `DataSize` is initialized only once (before the first call to `gRT->GetVariable()`).

Thus, if the data size of the variable in NVRAM is greater than 1, DataSize will be overwritten. Thus, the next call to `gRT-GetVariable()` may cause an overflow on the stack (and subsequent execution of arbitrary code).

In order to fix this vulnerability, the `DataSize` variable must be (re)initialized before each call to `gRT->GetVariable()`:

```c
  // ...

  DataSize = 1;
  result = gRT->GetVariable(L"UsbConfigPrimaryPort", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, &Value);
  if ( result >= 0 )
    LODWORD(v32) = sub_6528(Value);
  else
    LODWORD(v32) = 32;

  DataSize = 1; // <--- added
  result = gRT->GetVariable(L"UsbConfigSecondaryPort", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, &Value);

  // ...
```
