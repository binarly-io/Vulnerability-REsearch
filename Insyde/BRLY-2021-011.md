## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability could potentially be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

In the function at offset `0x172C` (image sha256: `9f110c958f2dae1c40369babcf3511324e7bc7f24e6b87c58ea74de7d4bcdb86`), the child software System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler with GUID `2970687c-618c-4de5-b8f9-6c7576dca83d` is registered:

```c++
Handle = 0;
gSmst_80005570->SmiHandlerRegister(SmiHandler_800016B0, &gSmiHandlerGuid, &Handle);
Handle = 0;
return gBS_80005240->InstallProtocolInterface(
            &Handle,
            &ProprietaryProtocol_80005190,
            EFI_NATIVE_INTERFACE,
            0);
```

Below is the decompiled SWSMI handler code:

```c++
EFI_STATUS __fastcall SmiHandler_800016B0(
        EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
        const void *Context,
        void *CommBuffer,
        UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
  EFI_STATUS Status; // rax

  if ( CommBuffer && CommBufferSize && !gExitBootServices && *CommBufferSize == 0x1020 )
  {
    switch ( *CommBuffer )
    {
      case 2:
        Status = sub_80002B00(CommBuffer + 32, *(CommBuffer + 2), *(CommBuffer + 3));
        goto _WriteStatus;
      case 3:
        Status = sub_80002A38(*(CommBuffer + 2), CommBuffer + 32, CommBuffer + 3, *(CommBuffer + 2));
        goto _WriteStatus;
      case 4:
        Status = sub_800029A4(*(CommBuffer + 2), *(CommBuffer + 3));
_WriteStatus:
        *(CommBuffer + 1) = Status;
        break;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

If the `EFI_EVENT_EXIT_BOOT_SERVICES` event was not triggered and the size of the communication buffer is `0x1020`, the handler performs different actions depending on the value of the first QWORD in the `CommBuffer`.

Let's consider one of the cases (`case 2`):

* if value of the first QWORD in the `CommBuffer` is `2`:

    * in the function `sub_80002B00`, data is copied from `*(CommBuffer + 2)` to `(CommBuffer + 32)`, the size is specified in `*(CommBuffer + 3)`

However, the following checks are missing:

* checking the size located at `*(CommBuffer + 3)`

Thus, a potential attacker can write fixed data to SMRAM to corrupt some data inside this memory (for example, change SMI handler's code or modify Smram Map structures to break input pointer validation for other SMI handlers, hence to completely make this mitigation inefficient). This could lead to gaining arbitrary code execution in SMM.

To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to wrap all the input pointers (including the nested pointers) for SMI handlers with sanity checks to make sure they are not pointing into SMRAM and add a check for the size located in `*(CommBuffer + 3)`.
