## Potential impact

An attacker with local privileged access can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 3 or ring 0 (depends on the operating system) to a DXE Runtime UEFI application and execute arbitrary code.
A malicious code installed as a result of the vulnerability exploitation in a DXE driver could survive across an operating system (OS) boot process and runtime or modify NVRAM area on SPI flash storage (to gain persistence on target platform).
Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by threat actors to bypass OS security mechanisms (modify privileged memory or runtime variables), influence on the OS boot process, and in some cases would allow an attacker to hook or modify EFI Runtime services.

## Vulnerability description

The pseudocode of the vulnerable function is shown below:

```c++
EFI_STATUS sub_21468()
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS]

  memset(MeSetupStorageData, 0, 0x11);
  memset(MeBackupStorageData, 0, 0x11);
  DataSize = 1250;
  gRT->GetVariable(aSetup, &DRIVER_SAMPLE_FORM_SET_GUID, 0, &DataSize, Data);
  v4 = gBS->LocateProtocol(&ProprietaryProtocol_10, 0, &Interface);
  result = sub_2D178(v0);
  if ( !result && v4 >= 0 )
  {
    DataSize = 17;
    gRT->GetVariable(L"MeSetupStorage", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, MeSetupStorageData);
    gRT->GetVariable(L"MeBackupStorage", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, MeBackupStorageData);
    DataSize = 54;
    gRT->GetVariable(aMesetup, &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, &unk_119A20);
    sub_29338(v11);
    if...
    if...
    v2 = MeBackupStorageData[1];
    if...
    if...
    if...
    v3 = MeBackupStorageData[6];
    if...
    if...
    if...
    if...
    if...
    if...
    gRT->SetVariable(L"MeBackupStorage", &gVariableGuid, 2, 0x11, MeSetupStorageData);
    return gRT->SetVariable(aSetup, &DRIVER_SAMPLE_FORM_SET_GUID, 2, 0x4E2, Data);
  }
  return result;
}
```

Consider following code snippet:

```c++
DataSize = 17;
gRT->GetVariable(L"MeSetupStorage", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, MeSetupStorageData);
gRT->GetVariable(L"MeBackupStorage", &gVariableGuid, 0, &DataSize, MeBackupStorageData);
```

A potential attacker can change the values of the `MeSetupStorage` and `MeBackupStorage` variables.
If the size of the value of the `MeSetupStorageData` variable is greater than 17, then after the first call to the `gRT->GetVariable()` service, the `DataSize` variable will be overwritten (this means that the attacker is in control of the `DataSize` variable).
The second call to `gRT->GetVariable()` (for the `MeBackupStorage` variable) can lead to a stack overflow and arbitrary code execution.
