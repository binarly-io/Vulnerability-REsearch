## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into BIOS. Such malicious firmware code in BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

The vulnerability was found in the child SW SMI handler registered with GUID `3b46cda7-0bd6-4323-a03b-bdf94a023f0a` and located at offset `0x2158` in the driver.
The pseudocode for this handler is shown below:

```c++
EFI_STATUS __fastcall SmiHandler_2158(
        EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
        const void *Context,
        _QWORD *CommBuffer,
        UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  Num = 4;
  if ( CommBuffer && CommBufferSize && (-(__int64)(*CommBufferSize != 24) & EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER) == 0 )
  {
    Size = GetStrSize((_WORD *)CommBuffer[1]);
    CommBuffer1 = CommBuffer[1];
    Size1 = Size;
    Res = 0;
    if ( CommBuffer1 && Size1 )
      Res = SmmIsBufferOutsideSmmValid(CommBuffer1, Size1);
    if ( (-(__int64)(Res == 0) & EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER) == 0 )
    {
      if ( *(_BYTE *)CommBuffer )
      {
        if ( *(_BYTE *)CommBuffer == 1 )
        {
          if ( GetWideStrSize((_WORD *)CommBuffer[1]) )
          {
            Res1 = FactoryConfigHandler((_WORD *)CommBuffer[1], (__int64)&Num, 1);// possible heap overflow
            goto _Exit;
          }
        }
        else if ( *(_BYTE *)CommBuffer == 2 )
        {
          Res1 = BuildIdHandler((_WORD *)CommBuffer[1], (__int64)&Num, 1);// possible heap overflow
_Exit:
          CommBuffer[2] = Res1;
          return 0;
        }
      }
      else if ( GetWideStrSize((_WORD *)CommBuffer[1]) )
      {
        CommBuffer[2] = Validate((_WORD *)CommBuffer[1]) ? 0 : EFI_CRC_ERROR;
        return 0;
      }
      CommBuffer[2] = EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

If the initial checks pass, the following happens in this handler:

* if the first byte from `CommBuffer` is `1` and a pointer to a wide string is located at offset `CommBuffer + 8`, then function `FactoryConfigHandler` (offset: `0x1A60`) will be called
* if the first byte from `CommBuffer` is `2` and a pointer to a wide string is located at offset `CommBuffer + 8`, then function `BuildIdHandler` (offset: `0x1C88`) will be called

### BuildIdHandler

Consider the `FactoryConfigHandler` function.

```c++
Status = SmmGetVariable(L"FactoryConfig", &VariableValue);
if ( Stautus )
    goto _Exit;
if ( GetWideStrSize(StringFromCommBufferPtr) )
{
    StrSize = GetStrSize(StringFromCommBufferPtr);
    Value = VariableValue;
    if ( VariableValue && StrSize )
    {
        if ( StrSize > 500 )
        StrSize = 500;
        if ( VariableValue != StringFromCommBufferPtr )
        CopyMem(VariableValue, StringFromCommBufferPtr, StrSize);
    }
...
}
```

`SmmGetVariable` function will do the following:

* gets the size of the `FactoryConfig` NVRAM variable
* allocates a buffer with `gSmst->SmmAllocatePool(EfiRuntimeServicesData, Size, &Buffer)` (inside `SmmAllocatePool`, offset: `0x2F98`)
* сopies the value of the `FactoryConfig` NVRAM variable to the allocated buffer
* as a result, the `VariableValue` variable will contain the address of the buffer in the heap containing the value of the `FactoryConfig` variable
    * at the same time, we control the size of this buffer, because we can change the `FactoryConfig` NVRAM variable


`CopyMem` will copy the data at the address that an attacker can control into `VariableValue`. In this case, the size of the data copied is equal to the size of the string located at the controlled address in CommBuffer (but not more than `500`).

In other words, attacker control both buffers:
* the size of the destination buffer
* the size and data of the source buffer

This will lead to a heap buffer overflow.

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. If the size of the `FactoryConfig` NVRAM variable >= 500, set the value of this variable so that its size is less than 500
2. Setup Communication Buffer:
    * `02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`
    * pointer to wide string with size >= 500
    * `00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`
3. Trigger the SW SMI Handler (SW SMI number and pointer to Communication Buffer are specified in UEFI ACPI table) via `0xB2` IO port.

### BuildIdHandler

This function has the same vulnerability.
But the allocated buffer will contain the value of the `BuildId` variable, and the maximum data size that can be written in the allocated buffer is `112`.

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. If the size of the `BuildId` NVRAM variable >= 112, set the value of this variable so that its size is less than 112
2. Setup Communication Buffer:
    * `01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`
    * pointer to wide string with size >= 112
    * `00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00`
3. Trigger the SW SMI Handler (SW SMI number and pointer to Communication Buffer are specified in UEFI ACPI table) via `0xB2` IO port
