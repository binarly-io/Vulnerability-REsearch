## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability could potentially be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

First, let's look at a routine located at offset `0x29C8` in the `NvmExpressDxe` driver. Its DXE branch (code intended to be executed during DXE phase) allocates a buffer for a protocol in the system memory:

```C++
if ( IsSmstFound() )
{
    // SMM branch
    ...
}
else
{
    // DXE branch
    result = gEfiBootServices->AllocatePool(EfiReservedMemoryType, 0x38, &gBuffer);
    if ( result >= 0 )
    {
        gCommBuffer = gBuffer;
        gCommSize = 0x38;
        
        ZeroMemory((char *)gBuffer, 0x38);
        
        ...
        
        gUnknownProtocol = (char *)gCommBuffer + 0x18;
        
        ...
              v6 = sub_80002FE8(0x38ui64);
              gCommBuffer_plus10_val = v6;
              if ( !v6 )
                return 0x8000000000000009;
              *((_QWORD *)v6 + 2) = 'IPVN';
              
              ...

              gEfiBootServices->InstallProtocolInterface((EFI_HANDLE *)&UnknownProtocolEffb22f6, &gUnknownProtocolGuid, EFI_NATIVE_INTERFACE, gUnknownProtocol);

        ...
}
```

The SMM branch (code intended to be executed in System Management Mode) of this function extracts the pointer to the buffer and registers a child software System Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler with GUID `52c78312-8edc-4233-98f2-1a1aa5e388a5`, which contains the actual vulnerability:

```C++
if ( IsSmstFound() )
{
    // SMM branch
    gEfiBootServices->LocateProtocol(&gUnknownProtocolGuid, 0i64, &gUnknownProtocol);

    v7 = 0;
    gSmst->SmiHandlerRegister(SmiHandler, &gSmiHandlerGuid, &v7);
}
else
{
    // DXE branch
    ...
}
```

The SMI handler itself is located at offset `0x2F90` in the driver:

```C++
EFI_STATUS SmiHandler(EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle, void *Context, void *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
  if ( gUnknownProtocol == CommBuffer && *CommBufferSize == 0x20 && CommBuffer )
  {
    gCommBuffer_plus10_val = *((_QWORD *)CommBuffer + 2);
    if ( *(_QWORD *)CommBuffer == 1 )
    {
      result = sub_8000358C();
      if ( (result & 0x8000000000000000) != 0 )
        return result;
    }
    else
    {
      if ( *(_QWORD *)CommBuffer != 3 )
        return 0x8000000000000003;
      sub_80003484();
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
```

Obviously, an attacker can craft the Communication Buffer contents to enter the `sub_8000358C()` routine that starts with the following code:

```C++
for ( ptr = ReadQword(gCommBuffer_plus10_val); ; ptr = ReadQword2(gCommBuffer_plus10_val, ptr_1) )
  {
    if ( Compare(gCommBuffer_plus10_val, ptr) )
      break;
    v2 = *(_QWORD *)(ptr - 16);
    if ( !*(_BYTE *)(ptr - 8) )
    {
      *(_QWORD *)(ptr - 0x1D0) = 04;
      if ( *(_BYTE *)(*(_QWORD *)(v2 + 192) + 256) & 1 )
      {
        *(_QWORD *)(ptr - 208) = sub_80004F70;
        *(_QWORD *)(ptr - 200) = sub_800050FC;

...
```

`ReadQword()` routine is used to dereference the input pointer.

As we can see, some `ptr` is set in a loop from a buffer pointed by `gCommBuffer_plus10_val` (which was previously retrieved from Communication Buffer), and if a simple validation is successful some data will be written into a location relative to `ptr`. There is no pointer validation carried out (to ensure `ptr` and any other Communication Buffer nested contents are not pointing to SMRAM contents).

Since this buffer is placed in the system memory a possible attacker can find it and control its contents. Writing fixed data into SMRAM could allow a possible attacker to corrupt some data inside this memory (for example, change SMI handler's code or modify Smram Map structures to break input pointer validation for other SMI handlers, hence to completely make this mitigation inefficient). This could lead to gaining arbitrary code execution in SMM.

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. Find `gUnknownProtocol` in system memory (with `NVPI` signature or by dumping & analyzing physical memory from exactly the same device model with exactly the same firmware version).
2. A pointer to a place to write in SMRAM should be specified at offset 0x10 inside `gUnknownProtocol`.
3. Communication buffer should be at `gUnknownProtocol` location, so a pointer to it should be placed into UEFI ACPI table.
4. Call SW SMI (SwSmi number is specified in UEFI ACPI table) via 0xB2 IO port, prior to it SMI handler GUID `52c78312-8edc-4233-98f2-1a1aa5e388a5` and Communication Buffer size `0x20` should be specified in Communication Buffer.

To fix this vulnerability, it is essential to wrap all the input pointers (including the nested pointers) for SMI handlers with sanity checks to make sure they are not pointing into SMRAM.
