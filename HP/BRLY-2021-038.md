| [Device](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-prodesk-405-g6-small-form-factor-pc/38230306) / firmware version: `02.05.01 Rev.A` | 0193 | 40b09ebb66f7bf702edaaccb08a3f4a5ae96d1f08e1b14cb33b9341d6539fee2 | 12D06948-6569-42C9-ABA3-E12BACE7B234 |

## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by malicious actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

The vulnerability exists in child the SW SMI handler registered with GUID `4dd19464-68d5-4c6d-9a6f-a6049afed855` and located at offset `0x19A0` in the driver.

It should be noted, that the `HandlerType` is a stack variable in this case:

```
.text:000000000000160D                 mov     [rbp+HandlerType.Data1], 4DD19464h
.text:0000000000001614                 ...
.text:000000000000161B                 mov     dword ptr [rbp+HandlerType.Data2], 4C6D68D5h
.text:0000000000001622                 mov     dword ptr [rbp+HandlerType.Data4], 4A66F9Ah
.text:0000000000001629                 mov     dword ptr [rbp+HandlerType.Data4+4], 55D8FE9Ah
```

The pseudocode for this handler is shown below:

```c++
EFI_STATUS __fastcall SmiHandler_19A0(
        EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle,
        const void *Context,
        void *CommBuffer,
        UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  ...
  // size not validated, we can allocate small buffer, then write out of bounds
  CommBufferCopy = (unsigned __int64 *)GetCopy(*CommBufferSize, CommBuffer);
  if ( CommBufferCopy )
  {
    ...
    *((_QWORD *)CommBufferCopy + 2) = Status;     // OOB write
    CopyMemS(CommBuffer, *CommBufferSize, CommBufferCopy, *CommBufferSize);
    Clear(&CommBufferCopy1, *CommBufferSize);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

`GetCopy` will allocate a buffer of size `*CommBufferSize` and copy the contents of the `CommBuffer` into this buffer:

```c++
void *__fastcall GetCopy(UINTN Size, const void *Buffer)
{
  // [COLLAPSED LOCAL DECLARATIONS. PRESS KEYPAD CTRL-"+" TO EXPAND]

  result = AllocatePool(Size); // gSmst->SmmAllocatePool wrapper
  if ( result && Size && result != Buffer )
    return CopyMem(result, Buffer, Size);
  return result;
}
```

It means that `CommBufferCopy` is a pointer to a buffer on the heap with the size `*CommBufferSize`.
`*CommBufferSize` not validated in the SMI handler. Thus, if the `*CommBufferSize` is less than 24, then out-of-bounds write in heap buffer may occur.

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. Set up a Communication Buffer (with MessageSize < 24).
2. Trigger the SW SMI Handler (SW SMI number and pointer to Communication Buffer are specified in UEFI ACPI table) via `0xB2` IO port.
