# SMM callout vulnerability in combined DXE/SMM driver on BullSequana Edge server.

## Summary

**BINARLY efiXplorer team** has discovered a SMM callout vulnerability on a BullSequana Edge server allowing a possible attacker to hijack execution flow of a code running in System Management Mode. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.

## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability could potentially be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by the UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

The vulnerability exists in the child SW SMI handler registered with the GUID `56947330-585c-4470-a95d-c55c529feb47` and located at offset `0x1328` in the driver:

```C++
EFI_STATUS SmiHandler(EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle, const void *Context, void *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    if ( CommBuffer && CommBufferSize )
    {
        if ( *(_QWORD *)CommBuffer == 1 )
        {
            v11 = 0;
            if ( gEfiBootServices->LocateHandleBuffer)(2, &EFI_ATA_PASS_THRU_PROTOCOL_GUID, 0, &v13, &v11) )
...
```

As we can see, in case `1` is passed in the first `QWORD` inside a Communication Buffer, `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` pointer will be dereferenced to call `LocateHandleBuffer()`.

Usage of `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` and `EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES` is unsafe inside a code intended to run in SMM (from SMRAM), especially in SMI handlers, because a possible attacker with a R/W access to system memory could hook pointers in these tables to escalate privileges to SMM (ring -2).

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. Find `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` table in system memory.
2. Overwrite `LocateHandleBuffer()` service pointer in it with the shellcode address.
3. Set up the first `QWORD` of a Communication Buffer with a value of `1`.
4. Trigger the SW SMI Handler (SW SMI number and pointer to Communication Buffer are specified in UEFI ACPI table) via `0xB2` IO port.

To fix this vulnerability, it is essential that the usage of the `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` is minimised only to SMM driver's early initialization routine.
