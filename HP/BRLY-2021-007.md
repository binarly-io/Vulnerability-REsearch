## Potential impact

An attacker with local privileged access can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 3 or ring 0 (depends on the operating system) to DXE Runtime UEFI application and execute arbitrary code.
A malicious code installed as a result of vulnerability exploitation in UEFI application could survive across an operating system (OS) boot process and runtime or modify NVRAM area on SPI flash storage (to gain persistence on target platform).
Additionally, this vulnerability potentially could be used by malicious actors to bypass OS security mechanisms (modify privileged memory or runtime variables), influence on OS boot process, and in some cases would allow an attacker to hook or modify EFI Runtime services.

## Vulnerability description

The vulnerabile code below is located at offset `0x7B68` (firmware name: `S05_02020000.bin`, application name: `0138`):

```c++
bool CheckBatterySafety()
{
  EFI_GUID VendorGuid;
  char Buffer;
  UINTN DataSize;

  VendorGuid.Data1 = 0xFB3B9ECE;
  *&VendorGuid.Data2 = 0x49334ABA;
  *VendorGuid.Data4 = 0xD6B49DB4;
  *&VendorGuid.Data4[4] = 0x5123897D;
  Buffer = 0;
  DataSize = 1i64;
  return (!gRT_157B30->GetVariable(L"BatterySafetyModeStatus", &VendorGuid, 0i64, &DataSize, &Buffer)
       || !gRT_157B30->GetVariable(L"BatterySafetyMode", &VendorGuid, 0i64, &DataSize, &Buffer))
      && Buffer == 1;
}
```

If the length of NVRAM variable `BatterySafetyModeStatus` is greater than 1, the `DataSize` is set to the length of `BatterySafetyModeStatus` variable and a second call to `GetVariable` service will occur.

After the second call to `GetVariable` service, the value of NVRAM variable `BatterySafetyMode` will be written to the `Buffer` stack variable.

By controlling the values of `BatterySafetyModeStatus` and `BatterySafetyMode` variables, we can write any data onto the stack and thus execute arbitrary code on the stack.


## Steps for exploitation

Change `BatterySafetyModeStatus` and `BatterySafetyMode` variables.

By changing the value of `BatterySafetyModeStatus` variable, we change the value of the `DataSize` before the second call to `GetVariable`.

By changing the value of `BatterySafetyMode` variable, we overflow the stack and execute arbitrary code on the stack.

It is important to note that the `Buffer` value on the stack lies after the current function return address:

```
-0000000000000010 VendorGuid      EFI_GUID ?
+0000000000000000  s              db 8 dup(?)
+0000000000000008  r              db 8 dup(?)
+0000000000000010 Buffer          db ?
+0000000000000011                 db ? ; undefined
+0000000000000012                 db ? ; undefined
+0000000000000013                 db ? ; undefined
+0000000000000014                 db ? ; undefined
+0000000000000015                 db ? ; undefined
+0000000000000016                 db ? ; undefined
+0000000000000017                 db ? ; undefined
+0000000000000018 DataSize        dq ?
+0000000000000020
+0000000000000020 ; end of stack variables
```

So, it is necessary to overwrite the return address of the parent function and not the return address of the current function.
