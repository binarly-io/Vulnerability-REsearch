## Summary

**BINARLY efiXplorer team** has discovered a SMM callout vulnerability on a BullSequana Edge server allowing a possible attacker to hijack the execution flow of a code running in System Management Mode. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.

## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability could potentially be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by the UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerabilities description

The vulnerability exists in the child SW SMI handler registered with the GUID `1d3de7f0-0807-424f-aa69-11a54e19a46f` and located at offset `0x1E0C` in the driver:

```C++
EFI_STATUS SmiHandler(EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle, const void *Context, void *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    if ( CommBuffer && CommBufferSize )
    {
        if ( *(_QWORD *)CommBuffer == 1 )
        {
            LOBYTE(Context) = 1;
            Status = sub_80001508(*((_QWORD *)CommBuffer + 2), (char)Context);
            ...
        }
...
```

As we can see in case `1` is passed as the first `QWORD` inside a Communication Buffer the `sub_80001508()` function is called. The second argument of this routine indicates whether the function is executed in SMM (from SMRAM) or not, thus the routine contains the following constructions:

```C++
EFI_STATUS sub_80001508(__int64 Pointer, char InSmm)
{
    if ( InSmm )
    {
        // usage of gSmst
        ...
    }
    else
    {
        // usage of gBS
        ...
    }
}
```

Still, at least one `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` dereferencing operation is left without any dependency to `InSmm` flag:

```C++
...

Status = InSmm
    ?
    gSmst->SmmHandleProtocol(v15, &EFI_ATA_PASS_THRU_PROTOCOL_GUID, (void **)&EfiAtaPassThruProtocol)
    :
    gEfiBootServices->HandleProtocol(v15, &EFI_ATA_PASS_THRU_PROTOCOL_GUID, (void **)&EfiAtaPassThruProtocol);
				
if ( !Status )
{
    if ( EfiAtaPassThruProtocol )
    {
        Status = gEfiBootServices->LocateHandleBuffer(ByProtocol, &EFI_DISK_INFO_PROTOCOL_GUID, 0, &v46, &v38);
        
...
```

This vulnerable operation is possible in SMM in case `gSmst->SmmHandleProtocol()` returns `EFI_SUCCESS` and `EfiAtaPassThruProtocol` will be initialized by this call.

Let's go back to the beginning of the SMI handler. In case `2` is passed as the first `QWORD` inside a Communication Buffer the following code is executed in a loop:

```C++
EFI_STATUS SmiHandler(EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle, const void *Context, void *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    if ( CommBuffer && CommBufferSize )
    {
        if ( *(_QWORD *)CommBuffer == 2 )
        {
            ...
        }
        if ( *(_QWORD *)CommBuffer == 2 )
        {
            ...
		        
            while ( 1 )
            {
                Status = gSmst->SmmHandleProtocol)(*(_QWORD *)(v8 + 8 * v6), &EFI_STORAGE_SECURITY_COMMAND_PROTOCOL_GUID, &EfiStorageSecurityCommandProtocol);
                if ( !Status )
                {
                    if ( *(_QWORD *)(EfiStorageSecurityCommandProtocol - 0x20) == 'GOTS' && !*(_QWORD *)(EfiStorageSecurityCommandProtocol - 8) )
                    {
                        for ( i = 0; i < v17; v10 = i )
                        {
                            if ( !gEfiBootServices->HandleProtocol)(*(_QWORD *)(v16 + 8 * v10), &EFI_STORAGE_SECURITY_COMMAND_PROTOCOL_GUID, &v19)

...
```

Here is a similar situation: in case `gSmst->SmmHandleProtocol()` returns `EFI_SUCCESS` and valid pointer `EfiStorageSecurityCommandProtocol`, the `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` dereferencing operation has occurred.

Usage of `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` and `EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES` is unsafe inside a code intended to run in SMM (from SMRAM), especially in SMI handlers, because a possible attacker with a R/W access to system memory could hook pointers in these tables to escalate privileges to SMM (ring -2).

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. Find `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` table in system memory.
2. Overwrite `LocateHandleBuffer()` or `HandleProtocol()` service pointer in it with the shellcode address.
3. Set up the first `QWORD` of a Communication Buffer with a value of either `1` or `2`.
4. Trigger the SW SMI Handler (SW SMI number and pointer to Communication Buffer are specified in UEFI ACPI table) via `0xB2` IO port.

To fix this vulnerability, it is essential that the usage of `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` is minimised only to SMM driver's early initialization routine.
