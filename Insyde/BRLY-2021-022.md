# SMM callout vulnerability in combined DXE/SMM driver on BullSequana Edge server.

## Summary

**BINARLY efiXplorer team** has discovered a SMM callout vulnerability on a BullSequana Edge server allowing a possible attacker to hijack execution flow of a code running in System Management Mode. Exploiting this issue could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.

## Potential impact

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode - an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware backdoor/implant into the BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in the BIOS could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this vulnerability could potentially be used by threat actors to bypass security mechanisms provided by the UEFI firmware (for example, Secure Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors).

## Vulnerability description

The vulnerability exists in the SW SMI handler registered with number `0xF9` and located at offset `0x06F0` in the driver:

```C++
EFI_STATUS SwSmiHandler(EFI_HANDLE DispatchHandle, const void *Context, void *CommBuffer, UINTN *CommBufferSize)
{
    if ( !*((_WORD *)gSmmBuffer + 3) )
        return sub_80000D18();
... 
```

As we can see, depending on the contents of a buffer allocated in SMRAM pointed by `gSmmBuffer`, a routine `sub_80000D18()` is invoked that dereferences `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` pointer to call `LocateProtocol()`:

```C++
__int64 sub_80000D18()
{
    gEfiBootServices->LocateProtocol(&EFI_SMM_RUNTIME_PROTOCOL_GUID, 0, &EfiSmmRuntimeProtocol);
  
    if ((gEfiBootServices->LocateProtocol(&UNKNOWN_PROTOCOL_3D819F77_GUID, 0, &UnknownProtocol3d819f77) & 0x8000000000000000) == 0)
    {
        *(_QWORD *)(0x10 * *((unsigned __int16 *)UnknownProtocol3d819f77 + 1) + 0x32) = sub_80001104;
        *(_DWORD *)gSmmBuffer = 'S51I';
        *((_WORD *)gSmmBuffer + 2) = *(_WORD *)UnknownProtocol3d819f77;
        *((_WORD *)gSmmBuffer + 3) = *((_WORD *)UnknownProtocol3d819f77 + 1);
        *((_QWORD *)gSmmBuffer + 2) = sub_80000B2C;
        *((_QWORD *)gSmmBuffer + 3) = sub_80001040;
  
...
```

It is worth mentioning that `sub_80000D18()` is also called from the initialization procedure in this driver just after the allocation of `gSmmBuffer`. The value in `*((_WORD *)gSmmBuffer + 3)` will be initialized with a value taken from `3d819f77-ad7d-407d-8d44-e7a61f0cb49c` protocol. However this value could be `0` which allows the execution of the `sub_80000D18()` function in the SW SMI handler.

In any case, the usage of `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` and `EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES` is unsafe inside a code intended to run in the SMM (from SMRAM), especially in SMI handlers, because an attacker capable of executing code in DXE phase could exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges to SMM (ring -2).

To exploit this vulnerability it is enough to:

1. Find `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` table in system memory.
2. Overwrite `LocateProtocol()` service pointer in it with the shellcode address.
3. Trigger the SW SMI handler `0xF9` via `0xB2` IO port.

To fix this vulnerability, it is essential that usage of `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` is minimised only to SMM driver's early initialization routine.
